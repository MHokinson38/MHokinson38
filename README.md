### What I do 
 - SWE at [Skio](https://skio.com/)  
 - Recent graduate (BS in CS) and dropout (MCS) from UIUC.  

### Side projects 
Most of my hobbies include things like cooking, running, backpacking, going outside, touching grass, etc. The idea of grinding side projects or Leetcode constantly makes me want to tear my hair out, and I'd rather be a _wElL rOUndEd PeRsoN_. With that said, I have a few side projects I'm working on occasionally, namely:

- [ScheduleStuffer](https://github.com/MHokinson38/ScheduleStuffer): Tool for UIUC students to visualize courses in Calendar setting to help choose classes with fit in their schedule 
- [Foreground Extraction](https://github.com/MHokinson38/ForegroundExtraction): Image Foreground object extraction with various methods 
- [BotMacklin](https://github.com/MHokinson38/BotMacklin): Discord Shitposting Bot
- [Oort Cloud](https://github.com/MHokinson38/OortCloud): LAN based cloud file storage

### Other Interests

- Climbing (I Google'd basic tech bro and steered right into the stereotype)
